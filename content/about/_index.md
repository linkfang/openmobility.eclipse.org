COMMUNITY REVIEW DRAFT

May 04, 2018

## Vision and Scope

The OpenMobility working group will drive the evolution and broad adoption of mobility modelling and simulation technologies. It accomplishes its goal by fostering and leveraging collaborations among members and by ensuring the development and availability of the “OpenMobility framework”. This framework will provide the tools for a detailed simulation of the movement of vehicles and people as well as their communication patterns. It will be valuable for testing driver assistance systems, predicting and optimizing traffic as well as evaluating new business concepts, such as Mobility-as-a-Service.

It is the goal of this working group to deliver a framework of tools based on validated models, which are accepted as “standard tools” in industry applications and academia. Eclipse Foundation projects related to the OpenMobility working group will provide technical implementations of API specifications. The working group will:

*   Coordinate the development of related Eclipse Foundation projects towards an OpenMobility framework.
*   Define and manage the specifications for interfaces and functions for the framework.
*   Promote the OpenMobility framework and its value.
*   Provide a vendor neutral marketing and other services to the OpenMobility ecosystem.
*   Define licensing and intellectual property flows that encourage community participation and tool adoption.
*   Drive the funding model that enables this working group and its community to operate on a sustainable basis.

## Technical Scope

The OpenMobility working group will coordinate the development of Eclipse Foundation projects on the following topics:

*   Microscopic and Mesoscopic Traffic Simulation
*   Vehicle-to-Vehicle and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication Simulation
*   Pedestrian Dynamics Simulation
*   Simulator Coupling infrastructure
*   Interfaces to Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Intelligent Transportation Systems solutions

Projects hosted by the Eclipse Foundation in the context of the OpenMobility working group apply the Eclipse development process and best practices of openness, transparency and meritocracy. As such, these projects are open to participation by developers or contributors. They can submit contributions to the project that will be considered for inclusion by the project committers. Committer status is acquired by contributors after election by existing committers as described in the Eclipse Development Process.

## Incubation Period

The OpenMobility working group starts with an incubation period of one year that begins after the community review has been successfully accomplished. The goal of the incubation period is to

*   Refine the structure and strategy of the working group
*   Define membership levels and participation guidelines
*   Acquire new members for the working group
*   Develop and establish a funding model that enables this working group and its community to operate on a sustainable basis.

During the incubation period, only two membership classes and one governance body are defined (see “Membership”). Participant members and Committers of associated Eclipse Foundation projects are expected to actively engage in the development of this working group and the acquisition of new members. The participation fees for the working group will be waived during this period (0 € / USD 0 for all members).

The incubation period is concluded successfully, if at least four Participant members have been acquired and a funding model for the group has been developed and agreed upon. From here on, the working group shall continue with an updated charter.

If the operation of this working group cannot be ensured on a sustainable basis, it will be terminated after the incubation phase.

## Governance and Precedence

### Applicable Documents

*   Eclipse Bylaws
*   Industry Working Group Process
*   Eclipse Membership Agreement
*   Eclipse Intellectual Property Policy
*   Eclipse Anti-Trust Policy
*   Eclipse Development Process

All Members must be parties to the Eclipse Foundation Membership Agreement, including the requirement set forth in Section 2.2 to follow the Bylaws and then-current policies of the Eclipse Foundation, including but not limited to the Intellectual Property and Anti-Trust Policies.

In the event of any conflict between the terms set forth in this Working Group's Charter and the Eclipse Foundation Bylaws, Membership Agreement, Eclipse Development Process, Eclipse Industry Working Group Process, or any policies of the Eclipse Foundation, the terms of the Eclipse Foundation Bylaws, Membership Agreement, process, or policy shall take precedence.

## Membership

In order to participate in the OpenMobility working group, an entity must be at least a Solutions Member​ of the Eclipse Foundation, have executed the OpenMobility Participation Agreement once defined, and adhere to the requirements set forth in this Charter.

The OpenMobility working group is open at any time to all new members who meet these conditions.

During the incubation phase, there are two classes of OpenMobility working group membership - Participant and Committer. Each of these classes is described in detail below.

### Classes of OpenMobility Membership

#### Participant Members

Participant Members are typically organizations that view an open mobility simulation framework as strategic to their organization and are willing to invest significant resources to sustain and shape the activities of this working group. Typical Participant Members include industry users of the technologies and results provided by the OpenMobility working group.

#### Committer

Committer Members are individuals who through a process of meritocracy defined by the Eclipse Development Process are able to contribute and commit code to the Eclipse Foundation projects included in the scope of this working group. Committers may be members by virtue of working for a member organization, or may choose to complete the membership process independently if they are not. For further explanation and details, see the “Eclipse Committer Membership” ​page.

## Governance

This OpenMobility working group is designed as:

*   a member driven organization,
*   a means to foster a vibrant and sustainable ecosystem of components and service providers,
*   a means to organize the community of each project or component so that users and developers define the roadmap collaboratively.

In order to implement these principles, the “Steering Committee” as the sole governance body for the working group during the incubation phase has been defined.

### Steering Committee

#### Powers and Duties

Steering Committee members are required to:

*   Define and manage the strategy of the working group.
*   Define and manage which Eclipse Foundation projects are included within the scope of this working group.
*   Define and manage the roadmap of the working group.
*   Review this charter.
*   Define the working group budget and fees for all membership classes for each year.
*   Contribute to the acquisition of new working group members by actively engaging in community development and evangelism

#### Composition

*   Each Participant Member of the working group has one seat on the Steering Committee.
*   Two seats are allocated to Committer Members. Committer Member seats are allocated following the Eclipse "Single Transferable Vote", as defined in the Eclipse Bylaws. Elected Committer Members have the right to participate in every Steering Committee meeting. They have no voting rights

#### Meeting Management

The Steering Committee meets at least twice a year.

## Common Dispositions

The dispositions below apply to all governance bodies for this working group, unless otherwise specified. For all matters related to membership action, including without limitation: meetings, quorum, voting, electronic voting action without meeting, vacancy, resignation or removal, the terms set forth in Section 6 of the Eclipse Foundation Bylaws apply.

### Voting

For actions (i) approving specifications for adoption; (ii) amending the terms of the working group’s Participation agreement; (iii) approving or changing the name of the working group; and (iv) approving changes to annual Member contribution requirements; any such actions must be approved by no less than two-thirds (2/3) of the representatives present at a committee meeting.

### Term and Dates of Elections

This section only applies to the Steering Committee. All representatives shall hold office until their respective successors are appointed or elected, as applicable. There shall be no prohibition on re-election or re-designation of any representative following the completion of that representative’s term of office.

Elected representatives shall each serve one-year terms and shall be elected to serve from April 1 to March 31 of each calendar year, or until their respective successors are elected and qualified.

### Infrastructure

The OpenMobility Working Group uses the normal infrastructure provided to Eclipse projects, including, among others, mailing lists, forums, bug trackers, source code repositories, continuous integration servers, build servers, and web sites.

### Community Building

The Eclipse Foundation will provide access to its network of developers to facilitate the community building and the dissemination of the OpenMobility innovations. The Eclipse Foundation will use its communication channels such as its Newsletter, Twitter, or LinkedIn channels to promote key OpenMobility events and encourage its members to join and participate in the OpenMobility working group.
